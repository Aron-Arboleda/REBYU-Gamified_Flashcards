## Full-stack Web application that utilizes pixel graphics to implement gamified learning.

REBYU (Review, Educate, Boost, Your Understanding) is a
flashcard-based web app designed to bring a dynamic, game-like
experience to studying. Much like Quizlet, it allows users to
create, review, and test themselves with digital flashcards, but
it stands out by incorporating a vibrant, gamified visual style to
make learning more engaging and enjoyable. With REBYU, studying
becomes an interactive journey, encouraging users to progress and
stay motivated as they explore their chosen topics through playful
graphics and thoughtful design.
