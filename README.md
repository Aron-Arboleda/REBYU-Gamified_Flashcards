## Project Description

REBYU (Review, Educate, Boost, Your Understanding) is a full-stack web application that utilizes pixelated graphics to implement gamified flashcards learning. It's designed to bring a dynamic, game-like experience to studying. Much like Quizlet, it allows users to create, review, and test themselves with digital flashcards, but it stands out by incorporating a vibrant, gamified visual style to make learning more engaging and enjoyable. With REBYU, studying becomes an interactive journey, encouraging users to progress and stay motivated as they explore their chosen topics through playful graphics and thoughtful design.
